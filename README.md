__Pivot Table Creation
As part of the **Coffee Shop Sales Analysis**, four pivot tables were created to summarize key insights:

1. Sales by Location

This pivot table aggregates total sales based on different store locations, providing insights into performance by geographic area.

2. Sales by Time and Month

This pivot table organizes sales data according to both time of day and month, enabling analysis of sales trends over time.
Sales by Product

3. This table breaks down sales by product category, helping identify top-performing items.
   A drill-through feature has been implemented in the columns, allowing further exploration of detailed product-level data.
